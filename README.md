## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the calculator locally.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- [Optional] Node.js and npm (if using a build tool or local server)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ZakheleNdlovu/calculator_web.git
    cd calculator_web
    ```

2. **Open the app:**
    - Open `index.html` directly in your browser
    - Or, serve with a local HTTP server (recommended for some features):
      ```bash
      # Using Python 3.x
      python -m http.server 8000
      # Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
      ```

## Usage

- Click the buttons to enter numbers and operators.
- Press `=` to view the result.
- `C` or `AC` clears the current input.
